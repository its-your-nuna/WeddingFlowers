            <p>Check to make sure the Bouq you want is still available for your desired delivery date (Orders must be placed by 11am PST to be eligible for next day delivery).
                Check the status of the order you wish to change to make sure it isn't being prepped or en route. If it has, it is too far along in the process to be cancelled.
                Unfortunately we are not able to reroute an order to a different address if it is too far in the process to be cancelled. However, FedEx Delivery Manager may be an option depending on the recipient's address. You can find more information about it here.

        <!-- faq answer -->

        <div class="faq-body">
            <p>
                A Bouqs subscription makes life easier and gets you the best price possible (Up to 30% savings and free shipping!) on farm-fresh flowers. Whether you want flowers delivered regularly to yourself or to someone else as a gift, our flexible service allows you to customize many aspects of your deliveries including:
<ul>
<li>Where your flowers are delivered</li>
<li>How often flowers arrive, anywhere from once a week to once every 2 months</li>
<li>Our "Freshest Picks" collection offers a variety of flower types that change with the season.</li>
</ul>
About one week before your flowers ship you will receive an email preview of your next delivery. If everything looks good, you’re set.  If you want to change the Bouq or skip a delivery, you can do it all with just a few clicks.

Bouqs subscriptions are not set for a specific duration and will continue until you cancel. You can cancel when you'd like, for any reason. We hope you’ll stay, but we don’t make it hard to leave.

 Avoid these mistakes with your fresh flowers

Bud (bloom) Count vs. Stem Count

Our arrangements are either made up of a count of blooms or a count of individual stems. Lilies, for example, have 3-4 flower blooms per stem while tulips will only have one per stem. If you're unsure how many flowers to expect just check out the details on the product page!

Some of our more popular flower types may seem smaller or greener than you were expecting which is normal! 

Tulips arrive in bud form and will look like bulbs. This is normal because they come straight from the source and will bloom beautifully with trim and some hydration. Since these flowers are top-heavy, they only need about 1-2 inches of water and trim to fit the vase.
